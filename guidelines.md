# The dream 🍹

## The Mission

Dreaming about going on vacation after the course? Going somewhere far, far away?
What if we were thirsty from climbing the table mountain in South-Africa right now, or sunbathing a nice Hawaiian beach and in dire need of a cocktail?
One thing is for sure - we'd need to calculate how many Euros that way-too-expensive drink will be 💸

### Specifications

#### 🌱 Must haves

- Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
- Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form), and it'll tell you the price in Euros. You will need to get updated rates from external API's. You can explore a collection of free APIs on [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis), [like this one](https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/currency-converter5/) for example.
- Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)

#### 🌼 Nice to haves

- Allow the user to choose between different currencies
- Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)

### Alternatives

- You can replace this exercice with a crypto currency converter or a money to coffee converter (to know how much 💸 you need to get a certain amount of ☕).

    <summary>Step by step guidance (up to you if you want it)</summary>

    1. Create the HTML you need
        - What elements does the form need?
    2. Figure out what a form submit actually means / does
    3. How to get the form data after the submit?
    4. Calculate the amount in the desired valuta
    5. Figure out a way to provide this data in the HTML
